# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
In this project, lending data was used to create machine learning models to determine loan approval based on credit risk features. Modeling techniques of, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier were used to combat the class imbalance of good credit application vs bad credit applications. These techniques were evaluated and assesed based on accuracy, precision, senstivity, F1 score. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to evaluate different techniques to combat class imbalance in Machine Learning models. 

### Resources
**Data resource:** [Loan Stats](/Module-17-Challenge-Resources/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv)

**Tools:** Python, PANDAS, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn

**ML Model:** Logistic Regression, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier
